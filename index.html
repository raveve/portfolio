      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Raven has been a Charleston, South Carolina resident since the spring of 2010. Although she is no stranger to the Deep South, this is her first adventure on the East Coast. Born and raised in northwest Florida she also spent 5 years in Alabama obtaining her Bachelor and Master's degrees.</p>
        <p>As a part of the Lowcountry Community, Raven is involved in the Auburn Alumni Association's local club, the Lowcountry Auburn Club. Having served on the Board of Directors for 4 years she has held the role of Vice President for one of those years as well as President for one year. She is a member of the Eliza Lucas Pinckney chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution as well as a member of the Charleston Young Professionals and a participant in their Mentee program. Raven is also an active participant in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Charleston-Women-In-Tech/" target="_blank">Charleston Women in Tech</a>.</p>
        <p>In her spare time, Raven is training in Aerial Arts as her fitness routine. She is focusing on Aerial Silks and Trapeze, however, she has a small amount of experience in all of the apparatuses offered at <a href="http://www.aerialfit.com" target="_blank">Aerial Fit</a>.</p>
        <p>Although she has a past in varied fields and professions, Raven began her stint at <a href="http://www.boomtownroi.com" target="_blank">BoomTown</a> in the summer of 2010 and as a result found a passion in software. With many months of delving into <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com/raveve" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/raveve" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> she worked on obtaining skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Feeling that these skills, although valuable, were not very practical without having formal training in the field, Raven decided to take the leap into the world of coding by attending <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy</a> in Charleston for <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/" target="_blank">Front End Engineering</a> which began in January 2015.  After an intense 3 months she acquired her first position as a Front End Developer at <a href="http://www.blueacorn.com" target=”_blank”>Blue Acorn</a> where she worked for fourteen months. Raven's second position as a Front End Developer was at <a href="https://www.beyonddiet.com" target="_blank">Beyond Diet</a> where she worked for 6 months. Raven is currently doing a small amount of contracted Front End Development work for a new app and working on building her skills through some personal projects. Raven is in the market for a Front End Development position.</p>

        <p>"I worked with Raven on a few brief projects and really enjoyed her enthusiasm and attention to detail. She spent the time needed to make sure the project was done right and worked correctly as I imagined. One of her great skills is teaching others the basics of code. She is very patient and willing to go over the same principles more than once. It was a joy to work with Raven and hope our paths cross again."</p>

        <p>"Raven and I started the same day at Blue Acorn as Front End Developers in April of 2015. We are similar in that we had both transitioned to Front End Development from other careers, and were starting our careers at Blue Acorn. From the beginning, Raven stood out to me for being detail-oriented, eager to perform at her best, and always working on side projects in her free time in order to improve her skills as a developer. She is dedicated to being her best, and it is reflected in her continuously growing skill set.</p>
        <p>While I did not directly evaluate the quality of Raven's code, as we worked together on the same team and SQM was a more senior developer's responsibility, I can't recommend Raven more highly for her positive attitude, her enthusiasm to contribute as a developer team member, as well as to help plan fun company and department events in her free time. She dove right in from the beginning to contribute to the friendly and fun team-oriented culture at Blue Acorn.</p>
        <p>On client work, Raven willingly and eagerly challenged herself to tackle tasks that were somewhat beyond her scope of knowledge in order to learn and grow, and did not hesitate to ask for mentoring from more senior developers when she needed it. She also enjoys helping newer team members to learn the ropes, and generously shares information and tips and tricks to teammates, keeping in mind that the success of the team depends on such things.</p>
        <p>It would be a pleasure to work with Raven again at some point in the future, and I have no doubt that she will continue to excel as a Front End Developer."</p>

        <p>"When it comes to helping customers there is no job too big or too trivial for Raven. I had the privilege of working closely with Raven for nearly 4 years as she worked tirelessly to help customers in her support role and as she transitioned onto my team as a Quality Assurance Analyst. Raven was not classically trained in computer science or quality assurance, but she knew how to think like her client and was able to proactively help by affecting product quality. She was a great team member and was often looked to for her client-centric contributions in her Sprint teams. She often sought out additional training and was a self-motivated learner and would make a great member for a passionate and highly active and motivated team!"</p>

        <p>"I worked with Raven when she was a Senior Support Specialist for BoomTown. She was able to quickly grasp new features and share that knowledge with our client base through her impeccable communication skills. Raven was always able to clearly explain our product over the phone and in writing. Her work ethic is also one of her biggest strengths. She is always happy to help out her teammates and her company. We were sad to lose her on the Support Team but glad she followed her passions, moving into a QA role here at BoomTown."</p>
